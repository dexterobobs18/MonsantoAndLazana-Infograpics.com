You can use your free time to research a subject that was briefly discussed in class but that you find interesting, for instance, and gain more knowledge of computer science in the process.

	<img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\4467ceda95866abb6e9060609fc81360.gif" height="50">Although computer science students take a lot of practical classes, understanding theories can still be useful. You can accomplish this, for example, by researching the leading computer design firms to understand the approaches they use to their ideas.

Creating small programs, for example, can help you learn a lot about programming that classes may not teach you. You can even design and build your own computer to suit any needs you have and practice rebuilding computer hardware.

<h2 align="center">
	<img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\4467ceda95866abb6e9060609fc81360.gif" height="50">For any student, taking breaks and unwinding when necessary is an important part of learning. Increased rates of burnout can be caused by taking multiple courses with diverse themes and working nonstop on assignments. You can handle complex problems, come up with original ideas, and make sure that you are taking care of your basic needs, like eating and sleeping, by making time for relaxation.

<h2 align="center">
	<img src="C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\4467ceda95866abb6e9060609fc81360.gif" height="50">Making your own study schedule is essential because learning the practical aspects of computer science might take a lot of time. There may be designated study hours offered by schools and institutions, such as a reading day during final examinations, but you can utilize that day to unwind and unwind before final exams.
